# win10script
This is the Ultimate Windows 10 Script from a creation from multiple debloat scripts and gists from github. I also added Chocolatey and other tools to the script that I install on every machine.
- One command run standard: 
	powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JJgmB')"
- One command run gaming: 
	powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JJ54A')"
- One command run interactive: 
	powershell -nop -c "iex(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://git.io/JJjTa')"
	
## Run Instructions
   1. Right click on the windows logo
   2. Click on Powershell (Administrator)
   3. Copy the one command run for the script you want
   4. Paste that command in the powershell window
   5. Press enter
